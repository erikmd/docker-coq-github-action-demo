# This is a workflow example relying on docker-coq-action
name: CI

# Controls when the action will run:

# Triggers the workflow on push events for the master branch only,

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'
  pull_request:
    branches:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# This workflow contains two jobs, build and mathcomp:
